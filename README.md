#Rubiks Cube with Heuristic Solving Capability Borland Turbo C BGI GUI DosBox 90's School Work </br>

Playable Rubiks Cube Game with Graphical User Interface (GUI). Has a heuristic-based solving capability.  It's our school work during late 90's made using Borland Turbo C on a computer with 486 DX2-80 CPU (imagine no heatsink!!!) and floppy disks.  There are no guides available yet via internet,  we just learned from paper-based books.  :-P

The following video includes instructions on running it within Turbo C in Windows 10 using DOSBox Emulator.  Source code available in GitHub.

Enjoy !!!
